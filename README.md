# FuzR

Fuzzy approaches are used for modelling uncertainty and vagueness
present in real world systems. The performance of a fuzzy system is catalyzed by the
system-design. Fuzzy sets generalize classical crisp sets by incorporating concepts of
membership for a fuzzy variable. Each fuzzy set is associated with linguistic concepts
that are germane to a particular application. This paper presents an approach for
evaluating the region of certainty and uncertainty represented in design of fuzzy
linguistic variables. Fuzzy Resembler (FuzR) attempts to capture the goodness of a
fuzzy system design using a geometric approach. This can be used as a filter-based
analyzer for evaluating the design of fuzzy membership space. From the results it can
be inferred that FuzR presents meaningful observations of a fuzzy variable,
characterized by different membership functions such as Triangular, Trapezoidal and
Gaussian. FuzR can be used as a design evaluation parameter for evolving fuzzy
systems. Knowledge engineers can use it to optimize design of Fuzzy systems in the
absence of domain experts. Moreover, the level of abstraction provided by FuzR
makes it an abstract and an intuitive design parameter.
